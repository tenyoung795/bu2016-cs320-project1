To enable the extra credit predictor,
add the "-e" option before the input filename:
	./predictors -e <input-filename> <output-filename>

What works:
* All required predictors
* The extra credit predictor

Interesting things:
* To test all the sample traces at once,
  I wrote a Python script, tester.py,
  to run my program and diff the output with the expected output,
  concurrently per trace.
* The gshare and tournament predictors are really just variations of the bimodal predictor.
  You can even implement the gshare predictor as just a wrapper around a bimodal predictor.
* Like old C arrays, the C++11 standard library arrays can still be uninitialized if of arithmetic type.
* Initializing a vector of unique pointers is a pain in the ass.
* Using templates to remove boilerplate can create a net increase in boilerplate:
  the original boilerplate may be gone
  but creating the necessary templates can create more boilerplate.
